Smart irrigation system

 The Smart Irrigation System leverages IoT technology to provide continuous monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. The  aim of the Smart Irrigation System project is to develop a real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. Ultimately, the goal is to promote sustainable farming practices and conserve water resources while maximizing crop yield.
 
 Abstract

The Smart Irrigation System is an advanced iot based project which continuously monitors soil moisture, temperature, and humidity using sensors.Integrated with a GSM module, the system sends real-time data and alerts via SMS directly to farmers, enabling remote monitoring and timely action.

Area of utility
